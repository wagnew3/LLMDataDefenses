# Defending Large Language Models against Jailbreak Attacks via Semantic Smoothing

This is the official implementation for the paper [Defending Large Language Models against Jailbreak Attacks via Semantic Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16192). 

## Environment Setup

1. Install conda environment with `environment.yaml`. 

2. Download the pre-trained LLMs into the `model_weights` directory.

3. Specify the path to model weights in `config/${MODELNAME}.yaml`. An example config is in `config/llm/vicuna.yaml`.

Our implementation also supports calling a local vllm LLM server to improve the generation speed, checkout `language_models.py:VirtualLLM` and `config/llm/vicuna-vllm.yaml` for more details.

## Usage

For transfer attack experiment:

```bash
python transfer_attack.py llm=${LLM} task=${TASK} defense=${ATTACK}
```

For adaptive attack experiment:
```bash
python adaptive_attack.py llm=${LLM} attack=${ATTACK} defense=${DEFENSE}
```

For training the dynamic selection policy:
```bash
python train_selector.py llm=${LLM}
```

Here, `LLM` specifies the target LLM to be applied. The corresponding config file in `config/llm` folder is loaded. Similar for `TASK`, `ATTACK`, and `DEFENSE`.

Complete configs are in the `config` directory with detailed comments. Please checkout there.
