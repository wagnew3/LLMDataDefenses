In this task, you will receive a paragraph, and your task is to reformat it into Markdown document.

Follow the guidelines:
1. Ensure the result is a markdown document.
2. Ensure that each section title is meaningful and each section is a key point of the original instruction.
3. The section title could be following: task, requirement, constraint and others.
4. Make sure not to omit any critical points from the original paragraph.
5. Only reformat the paragraph. Don't change its semantic, don't add conclusion.

Input: {QUERY}

Now reformat the instruction in the input. Generate the formated document in a JSON object. The JSON object has only one key: 'reformat' and its value is the markdown.
