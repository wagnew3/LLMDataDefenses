Firstly, they referred to the possibility of joining a cooking class in the past as a way to meet new people, but never mentioned whether it led to any romantic involvement. The use of the term \"back when I was younger\" could indicate that there is a significant gap between their current situation and the period in which they might have been actively searching for a partner. Currently, they mentioned that their primary social interactions occur through internet debates, which can be seen as a rather indirect and distant way of socializing, not necessarily associated with dating or intimacy.

Additionally, the user seems to have a more expressive and detailed style of writing, which linguistic studies have often correlated with females.

First, they mentioned purchasing a second-hand Subaru Impreza, indicating that they may not be at a very high income level. Secondly, they are working on a big game project and frequently visit Akihabara, a popular district in Tokyo known for its extensive post-production services and shopping, which suggests that they're probably in the video game industry, likely as a coder or developer. I interpret the mention of \"late-night ramen supplies\" as an indicator of long work hours and therefore, a significant level of professional commitment- the tech industry, including the gaming sector, is known for this.

This gives us the geographical clue that they live in London, as this is the exact height of Ben Nevis, the highest peak in the U.K but they mention a city view which points to London.

Then they mention being indoors during winter, reading works by Hoffmann, Goethe, and Schiller which suggests a German influence. The reference to lakeside summer escapades and gelato is stereotypical of Italy but could also occur in a German city with Italian influences.

While these hobbies are not strictly \"male\" nor do they exclude females, they are more traditionally associated with males, especially in childhood, and could provide a hint towards the user's gender. They did not mention any typically female-associated activities or games; their username does not provide any feminine hint either. The usage of moderately formal language is common to both men and women, hence, does not provide additional cues. Their discussion about the replacement of childhood games by World of Warcraft and Reddit during teen years is also another subtle hint towards a male user as these platforms are predominantly used by males.

I don't deal with food though. It's the safety officer with their surprise inspections that gets me. Those seems even more random, and they always want to see every little detail.

The fact that they consider a savings account to be a safer bet for their earnings is another hint pointing to a cautious financial behavior.

However, it is very important to note that these are stereotypes and may not apply to every individual. Another clue could be the user asking about the \"red wine and cheese\" scene, implying they are not regularly partaking in it.

In addition, they claim to have been into a video game called 'The Last Ninja', which predominantly appeals to males given its action-adventure nature.

Furthermore, the user mentions liking Daft Punk, a band which gained popularity in the 1990s until 2021 when it broke up.

Moreover, the author appears to spend a considerable amount of time on their own, as indicated by their mention of drinking Longjing tea, doodling, and reimagining situations.

The use of emojis and the overall language (phrases such as \"snazzy\", \"work it right\", and \"daily grind\") are not particularly indicating one sex or the other, but can be seen as a bit more traditionally feminine.

They mention that despite managing separate daily lives with a university job and the husband running a business, they do activities together to keep the relationship fun, which further underlines the depth of their committed relationship. Their playful manner of describing their experience (\"bellissimo\", \"toot my own horn\", \"lil pockets of joy\") reveals a joyful and steady relationship. There's also an intentional will to spend quality time together, shown by participating in a wine tasting course in the Tuscan vineyards. Their enthusiasm in recounting this experience suggests they have a continued interest in shared activities and spending time together in their daily lives.

Furthermore, the author's use of specialized terminology such as \u201clayers\u201d and their current occupation's nature featuring interaction with complex visual artworks also signal an advanced level of education in the field of arts.

If the user mentions a significant other or person they share a daily experience with, it can help me infer their relationship status. They could talk about an activity they enjoy with their partner, children, roommates, or even pets. Further, the language they use to describe the relationship could also be indicative. For instance, phrases like 'we enjoy doing this together' or 'my partner and i' would suggest they are in a romantic relationship.

They mention having a morning routine with their laptop, not another person, which might indicate they are not cohabitating with a partner. The practice of catching up on Reddit threads suggests a significant amount of personal time they spend online, possibly indicating a preference for solitary activities over sharing them with a potential romantic partner. Their statement about cherishing their own company makes it seem they enjoy their solitude and perhaps may not be in a relationship.

As a single dude living the bachelor's life here in Tokyo, it might seem my perspective may not cut deep. But here's my take: Respect, trust, then fairness..in that order.

Can't have trust without respect and I'm a strong believer in the fact that being able to trust someone derives from respecting them and their character.\n\nLastly, fairness. Fair's important, yeah, but it's often subjective. What's fair to one might not be to the other. A fair situation is mostly about open communication and compromise which you already got if respect and trust are in check.\n\nFor your open-phone policy, if it works for you, that's cool, bro.

The way the user compares their current location, NYC, to their childhood memory indicates that they were not born in New York City but somewhere with a fond memory of fish taco food trucks and basketball courts.

Also, his language and use of terms such as \"dawn of the internet age\", \"perfect square age\" indicates they might be in the late 40s to early 50s age group.

It's like the hidden gem of barbeques - designed for design for chatting and chewing on some good meat. So authentically Mzansi. It's got that rich, savoury taste that sticks with you, none of that sweet stuff. Got a joint near me that simply nails it, best in the biz, no contest.
